# COVID-19 Data Analysis Repository


## About the Dataset

This repository utilizes the COVID-19 dataset provided by Our World in Data, available at https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. The dataset is comprehensive, encompassing global statistics on COVID-19 cases, deaths, testing, and vaccinations. It serves as a vital resource for in-depth analysis and visualization of the pandemic's progression and impact.


## SQL Queries for Data Preprocessing and Analysis

Included in this repository are SQL queries that serve multiple purposes:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleansing, filtering, and preparing raw data for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Aggregating data to summarize trends, calculate rates, and derive insights.
These queries are essential for transforming the dataset into a structured format suitable for visualization.


## Tableau Dashboard and Visualizations

The Tableau dashboard provides a visual representation of the COVID-19 data:

- **Static Visualizations**: Presenting key metrics such as total cases, death counts, and infection rates across various regions.
- **Analytical Charts**: Comparative analysis of the data by continent and country.
- **Trend Analysis**: Visual representation of the infection trend over time.
The dashboard captures a snapshot of the pandemic's current state and historical progression, offering a clear and concise visual narrative.
